**"Discrete Proper Time and the Tempo Lapse: A Retranslation of Gravitational Dynamics from Minimal Axioms"**  
Author: Toru Fujiyama  

## Abstract
Starting from a minimal set of core axioms - discrete proper time, unitary one-step evolution, and band-limited kinematics - this note develops a discrete-time, constraint-driven formulation that *retranslates* general relativity (GR).  
The approach closes consistently at the discrete level and recovers standard GR in the limit τ → 0. A discrete variational (implicit midpoint) scheme is introduced, which is symplectic, constraint-preserving, and converges with O(τ²) accuracy.  
Applications include cosmological backgrounds and linear perturbations, with corrections vanishing as τ → 0. The work demonstrates that the stipulated axioms are sufficient to reconstruct the dynamics of GR step by step.
